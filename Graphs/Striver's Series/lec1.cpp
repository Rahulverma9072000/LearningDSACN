//Path -> contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable

//Degree -> number of edges that go inside and outside from that node
//Degree of Undirected graph is twice the number of edges 
//Definition of Degree for Directed graph 
//Directed graph has indegree and outdegree
//number of incoming edges is INdegree
//number of outdegree is Outdegree 
//Edgeweight-> weight of particular edge
