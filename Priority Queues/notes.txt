Two Major Properties of Heaps : 
    Complete Binary tree
    Heap Order Property 

Complete Binary trees -> means except the last level every level should be completely filled
and the last level should be filled from Left to Right 
//Height of the Complete Binary Tree : 
Minimum number of Nodes with Height H of CBT : 2^(h-1)
Maximum number of Nodes with Height H of CBT : 2^h -1

//If the number of nodes is N,
than we can say that 
2^(h-1) <= n <= 2^h -1 

//height of Complete Binary tree will be logN always 
We can Proove this by above equation and taking log on both side 
CBT -> height -> logN

Main Concept is to store element in Array and Visualize like a Tree 
Simple Formula of CBT 
For an index i , Access thier children 2*i+1 , 2*i+2 
For an index i , Access thier Parent (i-1)/2
